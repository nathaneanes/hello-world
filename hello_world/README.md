# HELLO WORLD MODULE DOCUMENTATION

This module uses Features and Features Extra (specifically fe_block.module)
to store settings for a view output as a block. It also implements hook_node_view().

## Views

The view (hello_world_nodes) shows all nodes of hello_world_article node type
which have taxonomy terms from the 'Sections' vocabulary, as long as the selected
terms have their 'enabled' box checked. This view is output as a block and
assigned to the right sidebar. Since the sidebar h2 tag is not bold by default
in the Bartik theme, I added a drupal_add_css() to hook_node_view() to force the
bold styling.

This part of the functionality could also have been accomplished by manually
creating a block within the module, using the block hooks, which means this module
would not have required Features Extra. However, the method I chose is more
configurable within the Features UI.

## Hooks

The 'Content starts here!' text is created by the implementation of
hook_node_view(). During his hook, we prepend the message within the node->content
array. This could have been implemented as a block, but the method I chose has the
advantage of prepending the text directly to the node body, thus simplifying the
DOM and requiring no extra CSS.

## Known issues

The 'hello_world' feature appears as 'Overridden' as soon as it is enabled; the
views block is not properly assigned to the right sidebar. Reverting the feature
immediately after enabling fixes this issue.

## Changes to content_type_vocab_hello_world module

I changed one element of the 'parent' module, content_type_vocab_hello_world,
because it did not specify '0' and '1' as the options for the boolean field,
and this made it harder to use Views UI in selecting the value of 'enabled'.
